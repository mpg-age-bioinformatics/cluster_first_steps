If you would like to get access to the local cluster at the MPI-AGE
please mail bioinformatics@age.mpg.de.

Once you have been given access you can login to one of the 2 head nodes with:

```bash
ssh -XY UName@cluster.age.mpg.de
```

or

```bash
ssh -XY UName@cluster2.age.mpg.de
```

The first time you login you should download the following `.bash_profile` and source it:

```bash
cd ~
wget
